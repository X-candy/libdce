WHAT IT IS
----------

A library to remotely invoke the hw accellerated codecs on IVA-HD via a
syslink/rcm shim layer.

And an interesting project to try on my free time.

HOW TO BUILD
------------

Standard autotools build for cortex-a9 side.  The shim layer (dce.c) is
built for both cortex-a9 side (client) and ducati side (server).  The rest
of the bootup code and codec binaries are for now in an internal git tree
(linked as a submodule) until standalone codec libraries are made
available.

The corresponding ducati appm3 image is found in the firmware directory.
This replaces the official base_image_app_m3.xem3.

TODO
----

Migrate to newer syslink with RcmServer thread pool, to allow for using
more than one codec instance at a time.
