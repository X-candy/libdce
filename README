WHAT IT IS
----------

A library to remotely invoke the hw accellerated codecs on IVA-HD via a
syslink/rcm shim layer.

And an interesting project to try on my free time.

HOW TO BUILD
------------

Standard autotools build for cortex-a9 side.  The shim layer (dce.c) is
built for both cortex-a9 side (client) and ducati side (server).  The rest
of the bootup code and codec binaries are for now in an internal git tree
(linked as a submodule) until standalone codec libraries are made
available.

The corresponding ducati appm3 image (dce_app_m3.xem3) is found in the
firmware directory.  The Notify_MPUSYS_reroute_Test_Core0.xem3 from syslink
build should be used for sysm3 image.  The dce_app_m3.xem3 replaces the
official base_image_app_m3.xem3.

Note that for now the checked in dce_app_m3.xem3 only contains h264 and
mpeg4 decoders.  The other codecs are still only available with a proper
SLA in place.  Contact your TI representative.

TODO
----

Migrate to newer syslink with RcmServer thread pool, to allow for using
more than one codec instance at a time.
